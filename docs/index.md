# Sentinel MCP Documentation

Welcome to the Sentinel MCP knowledge base. This site covers everything from executive overviews to hands-on runbooks so both technical and non-technical stakeholders can navigate the control plane with confidence.

## Audience guide

- **Executives & risk owners** – focus on the Governance section for the business rationale, adoption plan, and policy playbooks.
- **Platform engineers & security teams** – dive into the Technical Guides for architecture, provisioning, and the testing strategy.
- **Operators & on-call responders** – start with the Operations runbooks and security controls.

## Quick facts

- **What:** Sentinel MCP inventories Model-Context Protocol skills/tools, enforces policies, rate limits, and near-real-time kill switches with signed provenance for every action.
- **Why now:** Agent stacks are entering production; unified governance and kill switch capabilities are required to mitigate tool sprawl and audit gaps.
- **Status:** Personal R&D build. Expect rapid iteration.
